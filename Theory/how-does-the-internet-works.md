# <u>***How does the internet works***</u>
this is a *very short* summary from what I've understood from [this videos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc)
<br></br>
First of all you need to see the internet like a wire, beause that's what it is. He allows every elements (computers, smartphones, ...) to communicate whith each other, they all have their own and unique IP (Internet Protocol) thanks to who they can do that.<br></br>
That works by the fact that every information (pictures, emails, ..) that travels accros the internet are cut in small pieces called **"packets"**, who are reassembled into their original state when the destination is reached.
